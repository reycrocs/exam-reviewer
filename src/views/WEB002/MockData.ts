Initially, Activity C can be processed on machine Y for 8 minutes while machine X remains available. This overlap is crucial as it allows for maximizing the utilization of available machines.",

As machine Y is still occupied with its ongoing tasks, this sequencing prevents any idle time for machine X and ensures a smooth transition to the next activity. Following Activity A, Activity B can be performed on machine Y, which requires 5 minutes, again avoiding any machine overlap and ensuring continuous operation.",
